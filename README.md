This repository demonstrates some of the functionality that can be achieved using PyTest. You can use it to:
1. Play around with the already included tests or make your own.
2. Change or add code in src/receipt.py to see which tests will fail.
3. Learn about a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests automatically.
